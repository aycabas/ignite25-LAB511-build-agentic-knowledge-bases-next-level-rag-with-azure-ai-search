    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will:\n",
    "* Connect to an existing blob knowledge source that contains indexed documents\n",
    "* Create a knowledge agent that uses Azure OpenAI models for intelligent retrieval\n",
    "* Query the knowledge agent with natural language to get grounded, citation-backed answers\n",
    "* Explore the agent's activity and reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab environment has already provisioned:\n",
    "* **Azure Blob Storage** - Contains your source documents (PDFs about employee benefits)\n",
    "* **Azure AI Search** - Hosts the knowledge source with vectorized and indexed content\n",

    "The blob knowledge source uses [integrated vectorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-integrated-vectorization) to automatically:\n",
    "* Generate embeddings using Azure OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model\n",
    "* Create a search index optimized for semantic search\n",
    "* Connect your documents to the knowledge agent for intelligent retrieval\n",

    "The following resources have already been created by the lab setup:\n",
    "- ✅ Azure Blob Storage with uploaded documents\n",
    "- ✅ Azure AI Search service with knowledge source configured\n",

    "### How Agentic Retrieval Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a user query and conversation history, the knowledge agent:\n",
    "1. **Analyzes the conversation** - Understands the full context and user's information need\n",
    "2. **Query decomposition** - Breaks down complex queries into focused subqueries\n",
    "3. **Concurrent execution** - Runs subqueries in parallel against your knowledge source\n",
    "4. **Semantic reranking** - Uses semantic ranker to rerank and filter results for relevance\n",
    "5. **Answer synthesis** - Synthesizes the top results into a natural-language answer with citations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Query\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below asks about differences between two employee benefit plans. The agent will:\n",
    "* Search across the indexed PDF documents\n",
    "* Find relevant sections from both plans\n",
    "* Generate a comparative answer with specific citations\n",

    "An LLM-generated answer to your query that cites the retrieved documents. This is the primary output you'd show to end users.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. References Content (Sources)\n",
    "Source documents and text chunks that contributed to the answer, including:\n",
    "* Document names and metadata\n",
    "* Specific text passages used\n",
    "* Relevance scores and rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "These three components enable you to:\n",
    "* **Verify grounding** - Ensure answers are based on your actual content\n",
    "* **Build traceable citations** - Create links back to source documents\n",
    "* **Debug and optimize** - Understand why certain results were retrieved\n",
    "* **Tune retrieval parameters** - Adjust reranker thresholds and knowledge source settings\n",
