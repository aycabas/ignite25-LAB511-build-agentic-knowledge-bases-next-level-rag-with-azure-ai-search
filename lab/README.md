These instructions are for participants of the **instructor-led** Workshop "Build Knowledge Agents: Next-Level Agentic RAG with Azure AI Search" at Microsoft Ignite 2025.  Register to attend in a city near you at [Microsoft Ignite](https://ignite.microsoft.com/).

## Lab Overview

In this hands-on lab, you’ll build a Knowledge Agent using agentic RAG, the next evolution of retrieval in Azure AI Search. Connect your agentic retrieval engine to your data through smart source selection across multiple indexes and storage systems. Learn how to enhance planning using natural language guidance and generate grounded responses with citations or extractive answers tailored to your use case. By the end, you’ll have a fully functional Knowledge Agent responds over enterprise data.

## Pre-Requisites

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this lab, you should have a basic understanding of the following:

- **Python and Jupyter Notebooks** – You will write and run code cells directly inside a Jupyter environment.  
- **Azure Fundamentals** – Familiarity with Azure services and concepts such as resource groups, storage accounts, and authentication.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – A general understanding of how LLMs use external data for grounding will help you better follow the agentic retrieval flow.  
- **Azure AI Search and OpenAI** – Basic knowledge of what these services do (indexing, querying, embeddings, completions) is helpful but not required.

> [!NOTE]  
> You do **not** need to provision any Azure services or deploy infrastructure manually for this lab. All required resources including Azure AI Search, OpenAI deployments, and data sources — are pre-created and ready to use.

## Get Started

To begin, follow the instructions in the **lab511-knowledge-agents.ipynb** notebook provided in your lab environment.  

This notebook contains all the guided content, code examples, and explanations you’ll need to build and understand a fully functional Knowledge Agent. Make sure to run each cell in order and read the accompanying explanations carefully. The notebook is designed to be a complete, step-by-step learning experience.

Once you’ve completed the notebook and explored all the included capabilities, return to this page and select **Next >** to view the wrap-up and summary section.

## Source Code

The source code for this session is available in the [notebook folder](../notebook) of this repository.  
You can use it as a reference for future projects, extend it with additional capabilities, or integrate it into your own solutions built on Azure AI Search and agentic retrieval.
