# Summary

**Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰** Youâ€™ve just completed the journey of building a Knowledge Agent that plans, reasons, and responds over enterprise data. By following the guided notebook, you brought together everything needed to power real-world copilots and enterprise assistants.

This lab wasnâ€™t just about running code, it was about understanding how retrieval becomes *intelligent* when guided by a large language model. You explored how an agent can search across diverse data, make decisions about what to use, and deliver grounded, explainable responses that users can trust.

## What Youâ€™ve Accomplished

- Built a **Knowledge Agent** capable of orchestrating complex retrieval workflows end-to-end.  
- Connected to and retrieved from **multiple enterprise data sources** in a unified way.  
- Used **LLM-driven reasoning** to guide retrieval decisions and generate high-quality, citation-backed answers.  
- Experienced how **agentic behavior** â€” planning, adapting, and iterating â€” elevates RAG beyond simple search.
