# Summary

**Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰** Youâ€™ve just completed the journey of building an Agentic Knowledge Base that plans, reasons, and responds over enterprise data. By following the guided notebook, you brought together everything needed to power real-world copilots and enterprise assistants.

This lab wasnâ€™t just about running code, it was about understanding how retrieval becomes *intelligent* when guided by a large language model. You explored how an agent can search across diverse data, make decisions about what to use, and deliver grounded, explainable responses that users can trust.

## What Youâ€™ve Accomplished

- Built an **Agentic Knowledge Base** capable of orchestrating complex retrieval workflows end-to-end.  
- Connected to and retrieved from **multiple data sources** in a unified way.  
- Used **LLM-driven reasoning** to guide retrieval decisions and generate high-quality, citation-backed answers.  
- Experienced how **agentic behavior** â€” planning, adapting, and iterating â€” elevates RAG beyond simple search.
